Summary of findings:
Drivers who go to coffee shops once or more a month are fairly likely to accept a coupon, but more likely to accept one around noon. And even more likely when that coupon expires in a day versus 2 hours, and when it is cold. If we in fact know the frequency with which the driver visits coffee houses, we are very likely to have success offering 1 day coupons to drivers, and even more likely if we target specific times and temperatures. I would recommend this program if we can accurately know this information.
Absent the information about the frequency of coffee house visits, I would be much more hesitant to recommend the program. I'd have to look at the cost and benefits of the program very carefully before making a recommendation, but my initial position would be that offering coupons for coffee houses probably isn't worth it if we don't know anything about the customer's coffee house visiting habits.
